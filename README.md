# ignite-detox

Give your awesome [ignite](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite) a full [detox](https://github.com/wix/detox) - using tests, of course. No real applications were harmed in the making of this plugin.

```js
ignite add ignite-detox
```

You'll also get `ignite g e2e <testname>` for free. This will create a scaffolded test in the `e2e` directory.

## Warnings.
- Wix has released detox 8 as alpha, so this is what you're getting!
- There's no support for android yet, [for reasons](https://github.com/wix/detox/issues/608#issuecomment-400127354). Will look at this again once android support > 51 is re-instatated.
- This also means, no linux support. :point_up:

Enjoy!
